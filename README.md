# ProjectEuler
Hi! Welcome to my little GitHub home for my Project Euler solutions. 

If you'd like to learn more about Project Euler, please visit their website at https://projecteuler.net/

For those of you who know me in person, you'll know that I love math and enjoy problem solving. Solving these problems are an excellent way for me to sharpen both my math and my programming skills. 

This repository contains the code for my solutions to the problems. I've chosen to host them on the web here for multiple reasons. The first is because some of the algorithms and code may come in handy for other projects in the future. By hosting these online, I can access them from anywhere if I need to reference them later. The second is because it makes it easier to show people how I work through a problem. The third is so I can see how far I've come. The fourth, and probably the most important, is to learn how to use GitHub so I can begin using it for further project management. 

The vast majority of these solutions are written in Python (specifically Python 3) because it's the language that I know best. The solutions are only uploaded here once I've checked my answers over at Project Euler and verfied that I got the correct answer. 

If you got here by searching for answers to the Project Euler problems, I only ask that you don't use my solutions to cheat on the problems. The fun is in the problem solving, after all. If you've already solved the problems and are just searching for other solutions to the problems to see how other people tackled it, welcome! 

Thank you for dropping by! Have a nice day!
